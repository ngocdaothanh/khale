Ale is an Erlang web framework for Yaws web server inspired by Sinatra.

== Mapping from methods and URIs to controllers and actions

Maps are defined in controllers.

map() -> [
	get,    "articles",         index,
	get,    "articles/Id",      show,
	get,    "articles/new",     new,
	post,   "articles",         create,
	get,    "articles/Id/edit", edit,
	put,    "articles/Id",      update,
	delete, "articles/Id",      delete
].

Fixed parts are in lower case, variable parts are captitalized.

Function names are used so that filters can used their names.

== controller_application

This controller defines cross-cuts for all other controllers:
* Layout
* Filters
* error_404, error_500

== Action

For convinience, result is not forced to be the last line. Because each request
is processed by a separate process, an action uses BIF "put" to put things to
the process dictionary. The framework will collect them and build the response.



== Layout



== Session

For simplicity, only in-coookie session is supported.
